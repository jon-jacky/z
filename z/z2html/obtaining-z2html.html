<h1><a name="top">Obtaining and Installing <b>Z2HTML</b></a></h1>
<p>
<b>Z2HTML</b> is just a few scripts, a directory of images for the Z
symbols, and a stylesheet.  Use the scripts to translate your LaTeX
source to HTML.  The HTML pages contain links to the images.  The
stylesheet controls the appearance of the Z text.

<h2><a name="scripts">Scripts</a></h2>


<p>
The <b>z2html.sed</b> script is the first pass; it translates the Z
LaTeX macros and some other LaTeX commands to HTML.  
</p>

<p>
The <b>paragraph.awk</b> script is the second pass; it puts paragraph
tags around each informal paragraph with so they don't all run
together in the browser.  It also puts paragraph tags between
consecutive Z formulas to provide some space.
</p>

<p>
The <b>z2html</b> shell command
invokes these two scripts in a pipeline, taking the name of the LaTeX
source file from the command line.
</p>

<p>
The <b>toc.sed</b> script creates a table of contents from the HTML
output of <b>z2html.sed</b>.
</p>

<p>
The scripts are just text files.  Use your browser's <b>Save As...</b>
function to copy them.  Here they are:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="z2html.txt">z2html.sed</a></li>
<li><a href="paragraph.txt">paragraph.awk</a></li>
<li><a href="z2html-cmd.txt">z2html</a></li>
<li><a href="toc.txt">toc.sed</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Here are links to a <a href="z2html-nostyle.html">no-style-sheet</a> version
and a <a href="z2html-symbol.html">symbol-font</a> version.
</p>

<p>
(Note that the file at the link shown as <b>z2html.sed</b> is named
<b>z2html.txt</b> so your browser will display it.  Ditto for the
others. Be sure to rename the files when you copy them to your
system).
</p>

<p>
Obviously, you must run the scripts on a system that provides
<b>sed</b> and <b>awk</b>.  If you want to use the <b>z2html</b> shell
command it must also provide a Unix-like shell with pipes.
</p>

<p>
The scripts were developed under Linux (Red Hat 5.2) and have also
been tested under HP-UX 10.20.  The <b>z2html.sed</b> script does not
work with the <b>sed</b> shipped with HP-UX -- it requires GNU
<b>sed</b>.  However the <b>paragraph.awk</b> script does work with HP-UX
<b>awk</b> -- it does not require GNU <b>awk</b> (<b>gawk</b>).
</p>

<h2><a name="images">Images</a></h2>

<p>
The <b>Z2HTML</b> tool represents the Z symbols with images.  The
<b>z2html.sed</b> script translates each Z symbol command in the LaTeX
source to an <b>img</b> link to an image file in the <b>zimg</b>
directory.
</p>

<p>
You can download this gzipped tar file of the entire <a href="zimg.tar.gz">zimg
directory</a> (less than 4.5 kbytes).
</p>

<p>
All of the Z symbol images linked to pages translated by <b>Z2HTML</b>
have names like <b>power-m.gif</b>, where <b>power</b> is the name of
the LaTeX command and <b>-m</b> indicates medium size.  The <b>-m</b>
medium symbol images were designed to look best with the <b>14 point
Helvetica</b> font with Netscape 4 under Linux on a 1024 x 768 pixel
display (usual for 17 inch monitors).  They look alright with 12 point
Helvetica also.  
</p>

<p>
The several <b>black-*.gif</b> and <b>clear.gif</b> images are used
to make the borders and spaces in the Z boxes.
</p>

<p>
The <b>zimg</b> directory also contains <b>power-s.gif</b> and several
other <b>-s</b> (small) images designed to match the 12 point
Helvetica font.  The <b>Z2HTML</b> tool does not use any of these small
images, and there are no plans to make a complete set.  Once there were
plans to make an <b>-l</b> (large) set to match the 18 point font.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to make your own symbol images, here are some <a
href="gif-howto.txt">instructions</a>.
</p>

<p>
In every directory on the web server where you install the translated
HTML output, there must be a <b>zimg</b> subdirectory that contains all 
the symbol image files.  The easiest way to provide this on Unix-like 
systems is to make a symbolic link in each directory to a single <b>zimg</b>
directory.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="stylesheet">Stylesheet</a></h2>

<p>
Pages translated by <b>Z2HTML</b> contain a link to an external
stylesheet named <b>zed.css</b>.  Use the stylesheet to control the
appearance of the Z text.  For example, you can specify the font and
size of the Z text to match the symbol images.  Here is the version 
used at this site:
<p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="zed.txt">zed.css</a></li>
</ul>
</p>


</p>
Follow this link for an explanation and other examples of 
<a href="z-stylesheet.html">Z stylesheets</a>.
</p>

<p>
In every directory on the web server where you install the translated
HTML output, you should also put a copy of <b>zed.css</b>.  Again, the
easiest way is to make a symbolic link in each directory to a single
stylesheet.
