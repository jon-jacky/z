<h2><a name="src">Preparing the LaTeX source text</a></h2>

<p>
<b>Z2HTML</b> translates a LaTeX source file to a single HTML page (not
a collection of linked pages).
</p>

<p>
<b>Z2HTML</b> understands the LaTeX commands defined in the
<b>zed.sty</b> and <b>fuzz.sty</b> style files.  Compare this HTML <a
href="../z-test.html">test page</a> to its <a
href="../z-test.txt">LaTeX source</a>.  See the comments in the source
file for more instructions.  See also these <a
href="../z-examples.html">Z examples</a> and their <a
href="../z-examples-tex.html">sources</a>.
</p>

<p>
(This <a href="fuzz-compat.txt"><b>fuzz-compat.sty</b></a> enables
files created for <b>zed.sty</b> and <b>fuzz.sty</b> to be used with
<b>oz.sty</b> under <b>LaTeX2e</b>.  All three style files are
available through links on the
<a href="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/archive/z.html">Z home page</a>.)
<p>

<p>
<b>Z2HTML</b> is not intended to be a full-featured LaTeX-to-HTML
translator.  There are many LaTeX commands which it cannot handle; it
simply passes these through, untranslated, to the output file.
You will probably want to do some editing of the
LaTeX source or the HTML it produces.  
<p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="translate">Translating the source files to HTML</a></h2>

<p>
Run the <b>Z2HTML</b> scripts to translate your LaTeX source files to
HTML.  
</p>

<p>
The <b>z2html.sed</b> script is the first pass; it translates the Z
LaTeX macros and some other LaTeX commands to HTML.  The
<b>paragraph.awk</b> script is the second pass; it puts paragraph tags
around each informal paragraph so they don't all run together in the
browser, and puts blank paragraphs between Z formulas to make some
space.  The <b>z2html</b> shell command invokes these two scripts in a
pipeline, taking the name of the LaTeX source file from the command
line.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, you must run the scripts on a system that provides
<b>sed</b> and <b>awk</b>.  If you want to use the <b>z2html</b> shell
command the system must also provide a Unix-like shell with pipes.
</p>

<p>
The <b>z2html</b> shell script is just one line: 
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>cat $1 | sed -f z2html.sed | awk -f paragraph.awk</tt>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
When you invoke the <b>z2html</b> shell command, there must be 
copies of (or links to) <b>z2html.sed</b> and <b>paragraph.awk</b>
in your current default directory (otherwise <b>sed</b> and <b>awk</b>
will not be able to find the scripts).  And of course the directory
that holds the <b>z2html</b> shell script must be in your path.
</p>

<p>
To view the translated output on your terminal screen, invoke the 
shell command like this:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>% z2html machine.tex</tt>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
To save the translated output, redirect it to an HTML file:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>% z2html machine.tex > machine.html</tt>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
If you want a table of contents, use the <b>toc.sed</b> script.  This
script processes the HTML output of <b>z2html.sed</b> (or
<b>z2html.sed</b> then <b>paragraph.awk</b> --- it doesn't matter) to
produce an HTML file containing nothing but a list of links to 
all the sections, subsections and subsubsections in the input file.
Invoke it like this (you must use the <b>-n</b> option):
</p> 

<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>% sed -n -f toc.sed machine.html > machine-toc.html</tt>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Then use a text editor to include the table of contents file
near the top of the original file.
</p>

<p>
(The <b>sed</b> scripts work with GNU <b>sed</b>.  They may not work
with some other versions, in particular <b>z2html.sed</b> does not work with the
<b>sed</b> shipped with HP-UX 10.20.)
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="stylesheet">Choosing a stylesheet</a></h2>

<p>
Pages translated by <b>Z2HTML</b> contain a link to an external
stylesheet named <b>zed.css</b>.  Use the stylesheet to control the
appearance of the Z text.
<p>

</p>
Follow this link for an explanation and some examples of 
<a href="z-stylesheet.html">Z stylesheets</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="server">Installing the files on your web server</a></h2>

<p>
The translated HTML files can go anywhere, but each directory that
contains them must also contain a subdirectory named <b>zimg</b> that holds
all the GIF image files for the Z symbols.
The easiest way to provide this on Unix-like systems is to make a
symbolic link in each directory to a single <b>zimg</b> directory.  
</p>

<p>
In each directory you should also put a copy of <b>zed.css</b>.
Again, the easiest way is to make symbolic links to a single
stylesheet.
