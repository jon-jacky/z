<h3>Z History</h3>

<p>
Annotated links to sources (by others, not me) that document
significant moments in the history of the Z notation.  They trace the
growth, then decline, of interest in Z.

<a href="proof-in-z-martin-1997.pdf">Approaches to proof in Z</a> by
Andrew Martin (1997): "Various attempts at supporting proof in Z are
described in the literature. This paper presents a survey of these
approaches, and the underlying semantic issues which make proof in Z a
non-trivial task. ...  Special care is given to an account of the
peculiarities of Z schemas. ...  The broad conclusion is that none of
these approaches is a clear winner at present ..."

<p>
This thorough report surveys the work of much of the Z community at
the time of its greatest expansion.  It explains some difficult
technical issues in Z better than any other source I know.
</p>

<p>
I think this report also shows why interest in Z declined from about
this time, though criticism of the community is never made explicit
here.  The Z community encountered technical issues that were at first
poorly understood, which turned out to be more difficult than
expected, and could no longer be avoided.  By then it was too late to
adopt the obvious solution of banishing the problems by simplifying
the notation.  Each group -- there were many -- tried to cope with the
difficulties in its own way.  No consensus solution
emerged. The community was fragmented.  The larger world began to
abandon Z.
