Annotated links to sources (by others, not me) that document
significant moments in the history of the Z notation.  They trace the
growth, then decline, of interest in Z.

<a href="proof-in-z-martin-1997.pdf">Approaches to proof in Z</a> by
Andrew Martin (1997): "Various attempts at supporting proof in Z are
described in the literature. This paper presents a survey of these
approaches, and the underlying semantic issues which make proof in Z a
non-trivial task. ...  Special care is given to an account of the
peculiarities of Z schemas. ...  The broad conclusion is that none of
these approaches is a clear winner at present ..."
</p>

<p>
This thorough report surveys the work of the Z tool-making community
at the time of its greatest expansion.  It explains some difficult
technical issues in Z better than any other source I know.
</p>

<p>
I think this report also shows why interest in Z started to decline at
about this time, though criticism of the community is never made
explicit here.  Here is how I remember it:
</p>

<p>
Z was supposed to be easy.  The author of <em>The Z Reference
Manual</em> (ZRM) (1989, 2e 1992) said, "We just wanted to use simple
mathematics to describe software".  But Z turned out to be harder than
expected.  Some Z users began to use the notation in a more flexible,
expressive way than shown in the ZRM.  They apparently believed that
their meaning was clear, and these were obvious extensions that should
not create new difficulties.  But in fact, they introduced subtle
complications which could not be avoided by tool builders.
</p>

<p>
A Z Standard committee began work around 1992.  The standard would
say what constructs are allowed in Z, and what their meaning is.
Instead of just codifying the contents of the ZRM, then the de-facto
standard, the committee attemped to accommodate the expressive
innovations.  They chose not to simply banish the problems by
standardizing a more restricted form of the notation.  They tried to
innovate and standardize at the same time, a perilous undertaking.
The committee worked on through the 1990s, producing a series of
inconclusive draft standards.  After several years, one frustrated
tool builder wrote, "The Z committee has missed the boat."  The
standard was not adopted until 2002 -- too late.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, lacking guidance from a standard, each group -- there were
many -- tried to cope with the difficulties in its own way.  No
consensus solution emerged. The community was fragmented.  The proof
tools were all incompatible.  Each tool used proof scripts that were
not usable by any other.  Even the kinds of properties that could be
proved varied from one tool to another.   This is the situation described
in Martin's report.
</p>

<p>
It turned out that Z was not so easy after all.  Z was was supposed to
be simpler and clearer than any programming language -- that was part
of its appeal.  But, like any programming language, it had its gnarly
corners that one might easily wander into.  The long-delayed standard,
and the proliferation of incompatible tools, made Z seem irrelevant to
software development.  If you are designing a system, you don't want
your notation and tools to be somebody's idea of a research problem.
The larger software development world lost interest in Z and today it
is mostly forgotten.
</p>

<p>
It could be argued that Z was doomed in any case because most software
developers were never going to write or use formal specifications in any
notation whatsoever.  In this view, the expectation some had in the
1980s and 1990s that writing formal specifications was going to become
a widespread practice was simply mistaken, a delusion experienced by a
few academics.  If that is true, the technical difficulties discussed
in Martin's report, the ordeal of the standards committee, and the
fragmentation among tool developers were not decisive.  This view is
supported by observations that contemporary alternatives, or
rivals, to Z such as VDM or B are also mostly forgotten.  And yet, 
a notation that emerged in that same period lives on and 
is used today. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLA%2B">TLA+</a>, which
appeared in 1999, is similar to Z (and VDM etc.) and now fills the
niche they hoped to occupy.  It has been used by Amazon and Microsoft.
It provides a focused and well-integrated toolset including an IDE,
a model checker, and proof support.
